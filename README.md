# A-Pathfinder

A* searching algorithm for moving GameObjects along a map. Currently developing this as a designer-friendly tool for a friend of mine.

Tasks under way at the moment:
-  Multiple layers of maps, which can be mapped to different player/enemy entitites
-  Path-interception behavior, so enemies can try to intercept the player at a future location
-  Export options, so designers can export ScriptableObject or JSON data of their maps and apply to other projects

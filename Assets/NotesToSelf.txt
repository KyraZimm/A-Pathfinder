TO DO:

Manipulating & Making Saved Maps
-  JSON option for map save data
-  Map auto-create options (eg. marking certain layers as unwalkable instead of editing each node, then generating that map for designer)
-  Save options for map-creation settings
-  Split MapMakingEditor grid from save file grid so that save button can be re-added to the Maker Maker Window

PathFollowers
-  More options for assigning map data to PathFollowers (eg. loading from pathfollower inspector, loading from a serialized reference, etc)
-  More PathFollower example types (eg. PatrollingEnemy, which loops a path until the Player is in view, then chases player)

Bugs:
- File name for exported save files is sometimes wrong
- Need to press "Edit Mode" button more than once

CURRENT TASK:
-  JSON and CSV save options for maps
-  file name bug fix
